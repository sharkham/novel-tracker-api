# Novel Tracker App (back end)

Ever wanted to run your own novel writing contest, or just keep track of your novel writing progress?

This is the Rails API for Novel Tracker, a single page [React app]() where users can create a novel project for a novel writing contest and view others' novel projects.


## Installation

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone the files to your computer
3. Navigate to `/novel-tracker-api` in your terminal
4. Run `bundle install`
5. Run `rails db:migrate`
6. Run `rails db:seed`. This step is very important as it loads badgetypes into the app!
7. Run `rails s` to start the server. Make sure to run the React app at the same time as well!
